# Daisuke-Signer
Daisuke Signer is an experimental iPA signer and website made using [zsign](https://github.com/zhlynn/zsign), a CJS wrapper, and Vite for a frontend. The signer
includes easy ways to sign any iPA file using custom certificates and the ability to modify
the iPA however you want using [cyan](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw)

> [!TIP]
> You can change App Names, Version, Bundle ID, and icons, as well as adding your own tweaks to
> make your sideloading experience easier.
